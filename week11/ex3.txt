1 output: Hello\nHello\n
2 output: Hello\n\n

This happens since stdout is line buffered:
In the first case, after printing "Hello" buffer will contain "Hello". At the same time in the second case, buffer will be empty since \n empties the buffer.
So child proccess has the same buffer as a parent hence why in the first case it was printed again, and in the second nothing was printed

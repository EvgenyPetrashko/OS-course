Deadlock detection - provides maximum concurrency and resource utilization.
Disadvantage is that roll-backs happen, also even if there is no deadlock cycle checking performed.

Deadlock prevention - is good when rool-backs are too expensive. Low resource utilization

Avoidance have no roll-backs but required to know resource requirements in advance.
